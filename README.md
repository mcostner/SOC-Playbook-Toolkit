# SOC-Playbook-Toolkit

This project is part of my personal journey toward cybersecurity excellence—built as a learning resource, a portfolio project, and a practical toolkit for other professionals aiming to break into or level up within security operations.

While I haven’t worked in a formal SOC role (yet), I’ve studied SOC workflows, threat detection logic, and incident response strategies through hands-on labs, formal education, and real-world environments as a systems engineer. This toolkit brings together that growing knowledge into a structured, useful format I wish I had earlier in my career.

## Purpose of This Project

I created this repository to:

- Reinforce my own learning by documenting what I’ve studied  
- Share useful playbooks and workflows with others in the community  
- Build something that reflects my dedication to mastering the craft  

Everything here is practical, vendor-neutral, and focused on real-world scenarios.
